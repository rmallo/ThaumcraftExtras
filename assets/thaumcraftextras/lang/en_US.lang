------Thauminomicon Entry------
tce.text.Thaumcraft Extras=You found out that there is a lot more in Thaumcraft then you expected. They call this Thaumcraft Extras.
tce.text.Shard Infusion=You have discovered a method to refine Air Shards by combining them with coal. Doing so makes them radiate a powerful light.  You’re sure that uses for this strange material will become obvious with time, but their strange nature makes them unsuitable for creating clusters. 
tce.text.Block Infusion=You have discovered a way to infuse blocks with an aspect, granting them special powers, and purifying them, making them a very good source of the aspect they represent. The first application you have found is rendering stone fluffy, light and air-enriched by combining it with an Air Shard. 
tce.text.Pech Trade=In your experimentation, you have discovered a special kind of gold fusion that leaves behind a strange amalgamation of precious metal. While useless for conventional crafting, the Pech place a high value on it, commanding very respectable trades. 
You have also noticed that these amalgamations fuse with each other, becoming bigger and more refined each time, for even better trading value. 
tce.text.Magic Trade=Noticing that your previous discovery had a notable amount of aspects within, it seems only logical that refining it further for better gains would be a logical next step. The fruit of your discoveries requires diamonds, but produces a huge amount of desirable Essentia, to both you and the Pech, who are still willing to buy it. 
tce.text.Air Block=The Air Block is an Example of an Infused Block. An Air Block is a block infused with elemental Air, and seems to exhibit some of it's gaseous tendancies, but only experimentation will show what it can be used for. 
tce.text.Fire Block=Infusing stone with a Fire Shard has created a block of condensed, solid fire. It radiates an intense amount of heat, enough to ignite any creature that passes over it. 
tce.text.Earth Block=Infusing stone with an Earth Shard has created a sentient, aggressive ecosystem. If it detects life above it, it will summon tall cacti to defend itself. You can see this being helpful if used in conjunction with some of your other discoveries. 
tce.text.Water Block=Infusing stone with a Water Shard has created a block of cool, solid water. This can be used for gardening purposes, as well as solidifying magma. It may also be scooped into a bucket in a pinch, but this will destabilise it and turn it into ordinary water. 
tce.text.Light Block=Infusing stone with your newly-discovered Light Shard has created a strange, glassy substance that emits a pure source of light energy, keeping your home warm and bright. Who doesn't love magic light?
tce.text.Wand Focus: Blink=This focus is an improvement over your previous discovery, focussing more on travel than combat – it calls on the ambient power of the End to create Ender Pearls to launch at distant areas, effectively becoming a crude means of teleportation. 
tce.text.Wand Focus: Arrow=This focus filters the air for materials like dust, loose leaves and the like, instantly compressing it into an arrow and launching it at your foes. 
tce.text.Wand Focus: Heal=This focus restores order to your body, healing the tiniest cuts and bruises to the most grievous injuries and broken bones.  
tce.text.Wand Focus: Speed=This focus splits the air around you, allowing you to blaze through the world without all that pesky air resistance. 
tce.text.Wand Focus: Pech Summon=The Pech are skittish creatures, so you have devised a way to create a special beacon to summon one to you, for any sorts of trades you may need. 
tce.text.Experience Extractor=Combining your work with trade materials and the lost arts of wands has created a special meditative crystal. By staring at an object and rolling the crystal in your hand (Right click while aiming at a block), the crystal coalesces your thoughts into shards of experience. These can be kept for later use or to be given to others. 
Both functional and therapeutic!
tce.text.Wand Focus: Experience=Further refinements to your crystal have allowed you to shape it into a wand focus, for coalescing your thoughts on the go, at the cost of some of your wand’s Vis. 
tce.text.Ignis Fuel=Coal can be refined and purified with a combination of Flint and Ignis, greatly extending its efficiency. Nine peices can also be crafted normally into a rough block, which is handy for storage and extended burn periods.
tce.text.Wand Focus: Exchange=This focus allows you to scramble the molecular structure of certain blocks, making them morph through some of their variants, primarily changing the colour of clay, wool and wood, and changing the quality of stone bricks. 
tce.text.Wand Focus: Return=This focus allows you ride the highway of the afterlife, sending you to your spawn point instantaneously.
